                    <p class="lead">
                        I spent the first three and a half years of my career in technical services at Iodine Software, a
                        machine learning healthcare company based in Austin, Texas. I started out as a Client Success Analyst, working with internal and
                        external stakeholders to efficiently resolve software related issues as they popped up. I distinguished myself by quickly
                        becoming familiar with Iodine's data environment and DB schema and used SQL to identify the root causes of client reported issues.
                        I also showed strong communications skills with end users, managers, and internal client success and engineering team members
                        to efficiently resolve these problems.<br><br>
                        My ability to solve technical problems and communicate effectively with stakeholders earned
                        me a promotion to Implementation Manager where I became responsible for leading hospital IT teams through our 16-week 
                        implementation process. I handled three to five projects at any given time, integrating and validating millions of medical
                        data points and working with client and internal team members to problem solve when limitations arose. In this role I gained
                        invaluable data and project management experience that has made me confident in my ability to work with complex datasets on
                        any team kind of team.<br><br>
                        My time at Iodine exposed me to the amazing power and potential of big data and machine learning. I thoroughly enjoyed building my
                        technical and PM skills within the technical services team, but I always felt drawn to understanding how we used the vast stores of
                        client data to create the models at the core of our software. During my tenure at Iodine I delved deeper than required into our data
                        science operations to understand the types of models we used, including neural networks and decision trees, how to indentify model 
                        inputs like NLP concepts and medical data points, and how to interpret model output and the associated effects on our products.
                        Ultimately I realized that I wanted to explore a career in data science and analytics and would need to enhance my skillset to do so.
                        At such an early stage in my career I decided to leave my comfortable situation and enroll in a Data Analytics and Visualization
                        bootcamp at UT Austin in order to kickstart this new career. I supplemented this course with a specialization in machine learning 
                        from DeepLearning.AI through Coursera as well.<br><br>
                        I'm proud of the work I have put in to build new skills that will propel me into a new career. I've created this website to showcase
                        the projects I've been able to complete, including the site itself! Please continue down to the "Skills" section and see the "Projects"
